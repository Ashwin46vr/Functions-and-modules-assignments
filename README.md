Task 3 – Code Writing (Functions & Modules) with Python.

In this repo you will find two simple Python scripts for Module 4:Functions & Modules in Python.

Task 1 –Factorial with a Function

We define a function called factorial().
It receives a number, and it computes the factorial of the number through a loop.
The code is simple as it only prints the facorial of one number here.

File: task1_factorial.py

Task 2 – Using Math Module

The user enters a number.
The program makes use of the math module to compute:

Square root
Natural log
Sine value

The results are stated simply.
